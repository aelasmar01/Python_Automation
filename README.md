# üîí Vulnerability Management & Security Automation Projects

Welcome to my repository of security-focused Python automation projects. This collection demonstrates my hands-on experience and technical ability in the domains of:

- Vulnerability analysis
- Risk-based security prioritization
- Identity and access management auditing
- Remediation tracking
- Secure DevOps hygiene
- Data-driven security insights

Each project is designed to solve a practical problem in modern vulnerability management workflows, ranging from data parsing and CVE enrichment to automation of monitoring, reporting, and basic analysis. Wherever possible, projects prioritize reusability, extensibility, and clarity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries (`os`, `csv`, `json`, `argparse`, `subprocess`, etc.)
- Selected third-party libraries for parsing, API integration, and analysis
- Optional tools for visualization, report generation, or system enumeration

## üìÅ Folder Naming Convention

Projects are named and organized by theme and complexity to aid navigation and scalability. For example:
- `access-audit-*` ‚Äì Access control or IAM-related tools
- `vuln-parser-*` ‚Äì Parsing and summarizing vulnerability data
- `cve-monitor-*` ‚Äì CVE-based alerting or enrichment
- `repo-scanner-*` ‚Äì Static or dependency-based analysis of source code

## üß† Why These Projects?

The goal of this portfolio is not only to practice writing secure and useful Python automation but to emulate the kinds of tools and processes that security teams rely on for:

- Reducing manual overhead in triage and investigation
- Identifying exposures before attackers do
- Enforcing least privilege and patch accountability
- Supporting remediation efforts with clear, actionable insights
